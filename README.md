# Collection of C++ Projects

This is a collection of my practice projects ranging from beginner to higher difficulties. I'll also explore other fields as I continue learning C++ like for example **"Console"**, **"Networking"**, and others.

I also have my [previous projects](https://github.com/AtumnMoon/Cpp-Examples-Old) where I suffered from bad project architechture.

## Projects

Below are the list of my projects. Currently there is only one yet. I'll also be linking my other practice projects from their own repository if they are too large to be here.

**Beginner:**

- [Simple Calculator](src/simple-calculator/)
  - It's a simple calculator that can shows simplicity and function over complexity and mess.
